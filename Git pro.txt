# Git has three main states that your files can reside in: modified,
staged, and committed:
 • Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.
• Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next
commit snapshot.
• Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database.

 # set username and Email

## Git Basics

# Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory
on working directory
$ git init

$ git add *.c
$ git add LICENSE

$ git commit -m 'Initial project version'

# Cloning an Existing Repository
$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2
  specify the new directory name
     $ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2 mylibgit

# Recording Changes to the Repository
   #each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: tracked or
untracked.
		#tracked files are files that Git knows about

#Checking the Status of Your Files
$ git status

#Tracking New Files
$ git add filename

#Short Status
$ git status -s

#Ignoring Files
create a file listing patterns to match them
named .gitignore
